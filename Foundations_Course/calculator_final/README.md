# The Odin Project's Calculator

Hi! This is final assignment from The Odin Project: Foundation Course. I've created a simple calculator which can do:

* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide
* calculate percentage of a number

[!NOTE]
This calculator shows a real time! (just because)

[!WARNING]
The calculator does not support Numpad (right now, maybe later?)
